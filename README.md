# Time Sleuth

A cheap and easy to build HDMI lag tester.  Through hole components were chosen to aid in assembly.  Resistors and Caps are still surface mount but a larger 0805 package size. 

An altera USB-Blaster is required to program the board. Firmware was created by Chriz2600 and can be found on his Github https://github.com/chriz2600/time-sleuth

For convenience the V1.1 PCB is shared on OSH Park.  Please order in 1.6mm thickness.

A 3D printed case is also available but not required for the unit to function.  The STL file can be downloaded from here:
